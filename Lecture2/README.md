## [@1m17s](https://youtu.be/FQPowZglpJA?t=1m17s) **ES6 Feature: "Arrow" Functions & Lexical `this`**
- Arrows are a shortcut syntax for writing functions
- Arrow functions have _some_ different behavior
- https://babeljs.io
- ES6 & ES2015 are the same thing
- https://babeljs.io/learn-es2015/#ecmascript-2015-features-arrows-and-lexical-this
- The Arrow: `=>`
- The Arrow and lexical `this`:
  > Unlike functions, arrows share the same lexical `this` as their surrounding code. If an arrow is inside another function, it shares the “arguments” variable of its parent function.
